Healthy Weight
========================================================

Reaching and maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can help you prevent and control many diseases and conditions. If you are overweight or obese, you are at higher risk of developing serious health problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, gallstones, breathing problems, and certain cancers. That is why maintaining a healthy weight is so important: It helps you lower your risk for developing these problems, helps you feel good about yourself, and gives you more energy to enjoy life.

Body Mass Index
========================================================

BMI is a useful measure of overweight and obesity. It is calculated from your height and weight. BMI is an estimate of body fat and a good gauge of your risk for diseases that can occur with more body fat. The higher your BMI, the higher your risk for certain diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, gallstones, breathing problems, and certain cancers.
Although BMI can be used for most men and women, it does have some limits:
- It may overestimate body fat in athletes and others who have a muscular build.
- It may underestimate body fat in older persons and others who have lost muscle.

Calculating BMI
========================================================

The Body Mass Index is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by the square of your height in meters:

$BMI = \frac{weight}{height^2}$

The BMI score means the following:

Score | Outcome
--- | ---
Below 18.5 | Underweight  
18.5-24.9 | Normal  
25.0-29.9 | Overweight   
30.0 and Above | Obesity  

Now Calculate your own BMI
========================================================

As an example here are the actual weight thresholds for someone with a height of 1.75 meters *(calculated using inline R evaluation)*:

Start of normal weight: 56.7 kg  
Start of overweight: 76.6 kg  
Start of obesity: 91.9 kg    

Now calculate your own BMI and determine if you have a healthy weight by going to the [BMI calculator](https://fwartena.shinyapps.io/Shiny/).
